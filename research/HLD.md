#### Project Title: Robust Brain Tumor Segmentation and Prediction

**Overview:**
The project leverages deep learning frameworks to identify and segment brain tumor subregions from multimodal MRI scans. Additionally, it predicts patient survival based on radiomic features extracted from these segmented subregions and clinical data. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosis, treatment planning, and risk factor analysis.

**Technologies:** Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, Database Management, Python, AI Ops Pipeline.

**Objective:**

- Segment tumor regions accurately using MRI scans.
- Predict survival rates based on segmentation data and clinical features.

**Scope:**

- HealthTech domain.
- Can be extended to other imaging-based diagnostics in the future.

**Key Features:**

1. MRI-based segmentation.
2. Survival prediction.
